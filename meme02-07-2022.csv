726,https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/g3j1m5/how_to_use_the_meme_investor_bot_what_to_post_on/,626.0,"**\*NOTICE: These commands will only work when replying to the pinned bot comment and not in an ordinary comment. The bot here is locked and as such can’t process you making an account.\***

Welcome to MemeEconomy, the place to share, discuss, and invest in meme templates. In this subreddit, we focus on sharing new meme templates to discuss how survivable the formats will be out there. We also focus on being able to invest in these formats using our own bot, u/MemeInvestor_Bot who can be used to invest in posts.

\*Also it's worth noting that you don't need or earn real world money or lots of karma to join this ""mini-game.""

#For TL:DR, read what’s in bold.

# How to use the bot

First you need to find any post on this subreddit with a pinned mod comment. This comment will be MemeInvestorBot or ""MIB"" opening the market for the post. **Reply to the comment saying ""!create"" to create an account.** So starting out it should look like

&gt; !create

Now that you have an account, **make another reply saying ""!welcome"" to get your free user stock.** It should look like

&gt; !welcome

Now you can buy and sell shares of posts that you enjoy, **be warned though as some posts can be breaking and can result in a removal.**

**To buy shares of a reply to the pinned comment on the post ""!buy x"" with x being the amount of shares you wish to buy,** so if you wished to buy 7 shares of a post you would reply

&gt; !buy 7

**To sell shares of a post reply to \*on that post\* ""!sell x"" with x being the amount of shares you want to sell off,** so if you wanted to sell off 8 shares of a template you'd reply

&gt; !sell 8

**You automatically sell off your shares after the default 4 hours** have passed, **but you can change it to be shorter or longer (1-12 hours) by replying ""!autosell x""** with x being the amount of hours you want before autoselling all of your shares on a post. So if you wanted to ""go pro"" and set the auto sell to 2 then it should look like

&gt; !autosell 2

**Or alternatively turn it off because you can handle it by replying ""!autosell toggle"". NOTE: You can use this command to turn it back on** after you realize your net worth has dropped.

&gt; !autosell toggle

**If you wish to quickly sell off all of your shares and assets in one comment, then reply ""!liquidate""**

&gt; !liquidate

**To see how much cash or Memecoins/M₵ you have on hand, check your net worth, and how much debt you still have** which let's be honest, will be more disappointing when you realize that this will happen in real life but with over-the-top interest, **comment ""!balance"" or ""!portfolio""** if you take yourself seriously.

&gt; !balance

&gt;\-OR-

&gt; !portfolio

Final thing to note for the ones who are really interested is that the [S&amp;P500 index](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=sp500+index) affects the MIB, so if it goes down, then it will take more shares to increase the cost/worth of a post, and if it goes up the worth of the post will grow faster, and this goes for all types of investments. Up and down.

You can also invest in user stocks by commenting on the pinned bot ""!buy"", then the number of shares, then the user's name all capitalized, followed by a :USER | So if you were to invest in me with 7 shares it would look like

&gt; !buy 7 THEMYSTERIOUSWARLOCK:USER

# How to earn Memecoins

The ""game"" can be summarized in one phrase

**""Buy low, sell high.""**

**If you expect that a post is going to be invested in by other users be the first (or near) to invest in it** at a low price, **and as other investors invest hoping that others will also invest in it sell out wait until the right moment to sell out** so you don't miss out on potential profit, but the other investors don't sell out and lower the price losing profits.

Of course you're not always going to be the first to invest in a post you'll have to make a risk of being undercut in hopes of others joining in to make a risky profit. However with a bit of luck, and *Reddit savvyness*, you'll be able to tell when a post is able to reach MemeEconomy's hot, signifying that the passive users who like to be on their home feed will see it or even r/popular where new users who aren't very keen on the sub will join in. Exploiting the uninformed to make an extra buck? Ah you'll get used to it, eventually...

# What do you post here?

This subreddit's main focus is sharing new templates that aren't just copycats of other templates, *most times since the mod team has different views on what is or isn't overdone templates, and if a post gets to a certain level of popularity we have to go through a slow process to determine if it's worth removing.*

Also in order to post here you will need to be at least a week old account, and 50 comment karma.

**\*Content and posts that are expected and/or encouraged\***

* High quality gifs which are also templates
* Short meme videos that still retain a format sense
* Versatile memes, meaning that they can be used and reused to have the same punchline but with different ideas.
* Text posts discussing meme trends
* ""Spin-offs""

**\*Content and posts that are not allowed and/or encouraged\***

* Spam
* One-shot memes. This isn't just another meme sub, and we don't wish to become one.
* Overdone templates (Think of the drake copycats, the personA hitting PersonB templates, the PersonA stopping thing or person from getting Thing, etc.)
* Old templates
* Low effort content, **NOTE: This rule is up to the mod's discretion, one mod's opinion may differ from another.**
* **TOS breaking content.**
* Sharing exploits in the system.",How to use the Meme Investor Bot &amp; what to post on MemeEconomy,1.0

Congratulations to all winners and big thanks to everyone who has participated!!! Please leave a comment with a link to the post in which you want your awards on, as for the nitro we'll dm it to you on discord itself. (All the finalists get awards, while #2 gets a ternion and #1 gets 1y discord nitro)


Thank you to all Maymay Makers and the r/dankmemes moderation team for having made this contest possible, thank you to everyone who added stuff to our prize pool and thank you to the main managers of this event!


Also, sorry for having made you guys wait for so long. This is the first time that we made a contest of this size and we honestly were a bit overwhelmed with the large amount of submissions at first. At the end of the day we were able to review every single submitted meme and start a final community vote for maximum fairness.


Stick with us in our servers to keep in touch!
